					<p>Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain</p>
					<p>I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days</p><br>
					
					<p>She told me in the morning</P>
					<p>She don't feel the same about us in her bones</P>
					<p>It seems to me that when I die</P>
					<p>These words will be written on my stone</P><br>
					
					<p>And I'll be gone, gone tonight</P>
					<p>The ground beneath my feet is open wide</P>
					<p>The way that I been holdin' on too tight</P>
					<p>With nothing in between</P><br>
					
					<p>The story of my life, I take her home</P>
					<p>I drive all night to keep her warm and time</P>
					<p>Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)</P>
					<p>The story of my life, I give her hope</P>
					<p>I spend her love until she's broke inside</P>
					<p>The story of my life (the story of, the story of)</P><br>
					
					<p>Written on these walls are</P>
					<p>The colors that I can't change</P>
					<p>Leave my heart open</P>
					<p>But it stays right here in its cage</P><br>
					
					<p>I know that in the morning now</P>
					<p>I see us in the light upon a hill</P>
					<p>Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still</P><br>
					
					<p>And I'll be gone, gone tonight</P>
					<p>The fire beneath my feet is burning bright</P>
					<p>The way that I've been holdin' on so tight</P>
					<p>With nothing in between</P><br>
